# 🔍 Sabre Credential Resolution Guide

## ❌ Current Status: All Authentication Methods Failed

The error `401 - Credentials are missing or the syntax is not correct` after trying all methods indicates the **credentials need verification/activation**.

---

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Sabre Developer Account Status

1. **Login to Sabre Developer Portal**
   - Go to https://developer.sabre.com/
   - Login with your account credentials

2. **Check Application Status**
   - Navigate to "My Applications" or "Dashboard"
   - Look for your application status:
     - ✅ **Active** - Should work
     - 🟡 **Pending** - Needs approval
     - ❌ **Inactive** - Needs activation

3. **Verify Credentials**
   - Click on your application
   - Check if the displayed credentials match your .env:
     ```
     Client ID: V1:xq3lzxku0rkguczn:DEVCENTER:EXT
     Client Secret: 67hwpTLR
     ```

### Step 2: Check for Required Actions

Look for any of these in your Sabre portal:
- **"Complete Profile"** - Additional information needed
- **"Verify Email"** - Email verification required
- **"Accept Terms"** - Terms of service acceptance
- **"Request Access"** - API access needs to be requested

### Step 3: Environment Verification

Ensure you're using the correct environment:
- **Test/Cert:** `https://api-crt.cert.havail.sabre.com` ✅ (Your current setting)
- **Production:** `https://api.havail.sabre.com` (Different credentials needed)
