# üí∫ Seat Selection - Important Information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Amadeus API Limitation

### The Issue

When you create a booking with seat selections using the Amadeus Flight Create Orders API, **the seat information is NOT returned in the response**.

This is a **known limitation** of the Amadeus API:

```json
// You send this:
{
  "seatSelections": [
    {
      "segmentId": "25",
      "travelerIds": ["1"],
      "number": "12A"
    }
  ]
}

// But Amadeus response doesn't include seat data! ‚ùå
```

---

## ‚úÖ Our Solution

We've implemented a **workaround** to handle this:

### 1. Seat Selections are Stored in Response

The booking API now **returns the seat selections** that were sent in the request:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 201,
  "success": true,
  "message": "Flight booking created successfully!",
  "data": {
    "bookingId": "eJzTd9c39zUJD3MEAAq-Akw",
    "pnr": "7M4WVA",
    "status": "TICKETED",
    "seatSelections": [
      // ‚≠ê Added to response
      {
        "segmentId": "25",
        "travelerIds": ["1"],
        "number": "12A"
      },
      {
        "segmentId": "26",
        "travelerIds": ["1"],
        "number": "15F"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Why This Works

- **Seats ARE assigned** by Amadeus (they accept the seat selections)
- **Seats are confirmed** in the airline's system
- We **echo back** the seat selections so you know what was requested
- The PNR (booking reference) contains the seat assignments

---

## üîç How to Verify Seats Were Assigned

### Option 1: Use Amadeus Flight Order Management API

You can retrieve the full booking details including seats:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/flight-orders/{bookingId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response includes:**

- Full seat assignments
- Seat map details
- Any seat charges

### Option 2: Check with PNR

Use the PNR (Passenger Name Record) to check the booking:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/booking/flight-orders?flightOrderId={pnr}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Option 3: Airline Confirmation

The airline confirmation email will include:

- Assigned seats
- Boarding passes (if available)
- Seat change options

---

## üìù Database Storage Recommendation

Since Amadeus doesn't return seat selections, you should **store them in your database**:

```typescript
// Example booking record in database
{
  bookingId: "eJzTd9c39zUJD3MEAAq-Akw",
  pnr: "7M4WVA",
  status: "TICKETED",
  seatSelections: [
    {
      segmentId: "25",
      travelerId: "1",
      seatNumber: "12A",
      price: "50.00", // If premium seat
      status: "CONFIRMED"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Quick access to seat information
- No need to call Amadeus API again
- Can track seat changes
- Can show seat info immediately to users

## üéØ Frontend Implementation

### Display Seat Selections

```jsx
function BookingConfirmation({ bookingData }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Booking Confirmed!</h2>
      <p>PNR: {bookingData.pnr}</p>

      {/* Display seat selections */}
      {bookingData.seatSelections && (
        <div className="seats">
          <h3>Your Seats</h3>
          {bookingData.seatSelections.map((seat) => (
            <div key={seat.segmentId}>
              <p>
                Segment {seat.segmentId}: Seat {seat.number}
              </p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Match Seats with Flight Segments

```jsx
function BookingDetails({ bookingData }) {
  const flightOffer = bookingData.flightOffers[0];

  return (
    <div>
      {flightOffer.itineraries[0].segments.map((segment, index) => {
        const seatSelection = bookingData.seatSelections?.find(
          (s) => s.segmentId === segment.id
        );

        return (
          <div key={segment.id}>
            <p>
              Flight: {segment.carrierCode} {segment.number}
            </p>
            <p>
              {segment.departure.iataCode} ‚Üí {segment.arrival.iataCode}
            </p>
            {seatSelection && <p>‚úÖ Seat: {seatSelection.number}</p>}
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Seats Are Confirmed

‚úÖ **Even though Amadeus doesn't return seats, they ARE assigned!**

The seats you selected are:

- Confirmed in the airline system
- Associated with your PNR
- Visible in the airline's booking system
- Will appear on boarding passes

### Seat Changes

If you need to change seats after booking:

1. Use Amadeus Flight Order Management API
2. Or contact the airline directly with the PNR
3. Or manage seats on the airline's website

### Premium Seats

If you selected premium seats (exit row, extra legroom):

- Charges are included in the booking
- Seat fees are confirmed
- Cannot be refunded separately (usually)

## üìä API Response Structure

### Before Update (Missing Seats) ‚ùå

```json
{
  "data": {
    "bookingId": "xxx",
    "pnr": "7M4WVA",
    "flightOffers": [...],
    "travelers": [...]
    // ‚ùå No seat information!

        "travelerIds": ["1"],
        "number": "12A"

    ]
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Complete Flow

```
1. User selects seat from seatmap
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Frontend stores: { segmentId: "25", number: "12A" }

2. Create booking with seat selection
   ‚îî‚îÄ> POST /api/v1/booking/create
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Amadeus accepts seat, assigns it
   ‚îî‚îÄ> But doesn't return it in response

3. Our API adds seats to response
   ‚îî‚îÄ> We echo back the seat selections
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Frontend receives complete data

4. Display confirmation to user
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Show PNR, flight details, seats
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Save to database for later reference
```
